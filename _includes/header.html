            <p><b>I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://informationsystems.umbc.edu/">Information Systems department</a> at the <a href="https://www.umbc.edu/">University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC)</a>, advised by Dr. Sanjay Purushotham. 
                I am working as a graduate research assistant at <a href="https://sanjayp.is.umbc.edu/">Dr. Sanjay's lab</a>. My primary research lies in the area of statistics, machine learning, deep learning, and healthcare. Particularly, my research focuses on identifying challenges in the healthcare domain, especially in the field of survival analysis, causal inference, explainable AI, and medical image analysis, and developing novel, efficient and interpretable solutions to address the challenges. 
                I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Statistics from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. 
                Before joining UMBC, I was an assistant director in the statistics department of the central bank of Bangladesh.</b></p>
